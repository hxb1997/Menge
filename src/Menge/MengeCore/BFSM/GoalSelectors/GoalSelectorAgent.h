 @brief   A goal selector that allows an agent to pick *another* agent to define its goal position;
          in essence, it causes one agent to follow another.
 <h3>XML Specification</h3>
 To specify an agent goal selector, use the following syntax:
 @code{xml}
 <State ...>
   <VelComponent .../>
   <GoalSelector type="agent" 
                 criteria={"nearest"|"farthest"|"random"|"nearest_nav_mesh"|"farthest_nav_mesh"}
                 nav_mesh="file_name.nav" >
     <Target type="named_state_member" name="agents_in_walk" is_member="1" state="Walk"/>
   </GoalSelector>
 </State>
 @endcode
 The agent goal selector has parameters *and* supports further specification via child tags.
 The parameters:
   - `criteria`: determines the mechanism for selecting one agent from a set.
     - "nearest": the nearest agent based on Euclidian distance in Cartesian space.
     - "farthest": the farthest agent based on Euclidian distance in Caretsian space.
     - "random": an agent is selected with uniform probability from the set.
     - "nearest_nav_mesh": the agent with the shortest path as defined by the indicated nav mesh.
     - "farthest_nav_mesh": the agent with the longest path as defined by the indicated nav mesh.
  - `nav_mesh`: the name of the navigation mesh to load (only required if criteria requires a
                navigation mesh.
 Child tags:
 If no child tags are given, the goal selector will draw from all agents in the simulator (except
 the agent being assigned the goal). Otherwise, the tags can be used to specify a subset of
 the population to pick one from.
 We re-use the AgentEventTarget functionality for specifing the set of agent. Each implementation
 of AgentEventTarget returns a set of agents according to a particular criteria. A sub-tree of
 such tags can be constructed to indicate the subset of agents to draw from. For example:
 @code{xml}
 <Target type="agent_union">
   <Target type="named_state_member" name="agents_in_walk1" is_member="1" state="Walk1"/>
   <Target type="named_state_member" name="agents_in_walk2" is_member="1" state="Walk2"/>
 </Target>
 @endcode
 provided as a child of the agent goal selector, will only consider the agents in the "Walk1" state
 or the "Walk2" states; agents in all other states are excluded.
